        I knew he musta been about seventeen<br>
        The beat was goin' strong<br>
        Playin' my favorite song<br>
        
        <br>And I could tell it wouldn't be long<br>
        'Til he was with me, yeah, me<br>

        <br>He smiled, so I got up and asked for his name<br>
        That don't matter, he said, 'cause it's all the same<br>
        Said: Can I take you home?<br>
        Where we can be alone<br>
        
        <br>And next we were movin' on<br>

        <h2>The Man Who Sold The World - Midge Ure</h2>
        <audio src="Audio/The Man Who Sold the World (2010 Remaster).mp3" controls>
        <p>We passed upon the stair
            <br>We spoke of was and when<br>
            Although I wasn't there<br>
            He said I was his friend<br>
            Which came as some surprise<br>
            I spoke into his eyes<br>
            I thought you died alone<br>
            A long long time ago<br>
            
            <br>Oh no, not me!
            I never lost control<br>
            You're face to face<br>
            With the man who sold the world<br>
            
            <br>I laughed and shook his hand<br>
            And made my way back home<br>
            I searched for form and land<br>
            For years and years I roamed<br>
            I gazed a gazely stare<br>
            At all the millions here<br>
            We must have died alone<br>
            A long long time ago<br>
            
            <br>Who knows? Not me!
            We never lost control<br>
            You're face to face<br>
            With the man who sold the world<br>
            
            <br>Who knows? Not me!<br>
            We never lost control<br>
            You're face to face<br>
            With the man who sold the world<br></p>
